    <div style="font-size:30pt;">Pardon the dust...</div>
    <div>I'm still working on getting all my code up and organized. Some repos may shift over the next few weeks.</div>
    <br />
    <div>I'm Greg, recent graduate from University of Colorado Denver with honors. This site will mainly hold the code projects I've worked on, both school and personal projects.</div>
    <div>My hope is this serves as a portfolio that can showcase some of what I've done in terms of software development and engineering.</div>
